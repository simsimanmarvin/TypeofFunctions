# Type_of_Functions_M3

This code defines a smart contract called FixedToken that implements the ERC20 standard. ERC20 is a standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The FixedToken contract allows users to create, transfer, and burn tokens.

# Overview

This Solidity contract defines the FixedToken token, which adheres to the ERC20 standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The code is licensed under the MIT license and is compatible with Solidity versions 0.8.17 and higher. It inherits from the FixedToken_erc20Interface and FixedToken_Metadata contracts, implementing their functions and events. The FixedToken contract manages token balances, total supply, name, symbol, and ownership, allowing users to create, transfer, and burn tokens.

# Functions

* The _balances mapping stores the balances of all token holders. The key is the address of the token holder, and the value is the number of tokens that the holder owns.
* The _totalSupply variable stores the total supply of tokens in circulation.
* The _tokenName variable stores the name of the token.
* The _tokenSymbol variable stores the symbol of the token.
* The _tokenOwner variable stores the address of the token owner.
* The constructor() function is called when the contract is deployed. It initializes the _tokenName, _tokenSymbol, and _tokenOwner variables.
* The onlyOwner() modifier ensures that only the token owner can call the functions that it modifies.
* The name() function returns the name of the token.
* The symbol() function returns the symbol of the token.
* The totalSupply() function returns the total supply of tokens in circulation.
* The balanceOf(address account) function returns the balance of the specified account.
* The transfer(address to, uint256 amount) function transfers amount tokens from the caller's account to the to account.
* The mint(address to, uint256 amount) function mints amount new tokens and assigns them to the to account.
* The burn(uint256 amount) function burns amount tokens from the caller's account.

# Summary 

In summary, the FixedToken contract is an ERC20-compliant token that enables users to manage tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates token creation, transfer, and burning, ensuring a seamless experience for token holders.
